  <h1>Well Hello There,</h1>
  <p>"Xassyria" appears to be a typo for Assyria, an ancient Mesopotamian kingdom and empire that existed as a state from as early as the 25th century BCE.</p>

  <p>Assyria was located in the Ancient Near East and is mentioned in the Bible, such as in the Book of Ezekiel, where it is described metaphorically as a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches.</p>

  <p>"Aha! the As·syrʹi·an, The rod to express my anger And the staff in their hand for my denunciation! I will send him against an apostate nation, Against the people who infuriated me; I will command him to take much spoil and much plunder And to trample them like mud in the streets. But he will not be inclined this way And his heart will not scheme this way; For it is in his heart to annihilate, To cut off many nations, not a few. For he says, ‘Are not my princes all kings? Is not Calʹno just like Carʹche·mish? Is not Haʹmath like Arʹpad? Is not Sa·marʹi·a like Damascus? My hand has seized the kingdoms of the worthless gods, Whose graven images were more than those of Jerusalem and Sa·marʹi·a! Will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols Just as I have done to Sa·marʹi·a and to her worthless gods?’ “When Jehovah finishes all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, He will punish the king of As·syrʹi·a for his insolent heart and his proud, arrogant gaze. For he says, ‘I will do this by the strength of my hand And with my wisdom, for I am wise. I will remove the boundaries of peoples And pillage their treasures, And I will subdue the inhabitants like a mighty one. Like a man reaching into a nest, My hand will seize the resources of the peoples; And like one gathering abandoned eggs, I will gather the whole earth! No one will flutter his wings or open his mouth or chirp.’” Will the ax exalt itself over the one who chops with it? Will the saw exalt itself over the one who saws with it? Could a staff wave the one who lifts it? Or could a rod lift up the one who is not made of wood? Therefore the true Lord, Jehovah of armies, Will inflict emaciation on his fat ones, And beneath his glory he will kindle a blazing fire. Israel’s Light will become a fire, And his Holy One a flame; It will blaze up and consume his weeds and his thornbushes in one day. He will utterly do away with the glory of his forest and his orchard; It will be as when a sick man wastes away. The rest of the trees of his forest Will be so few that a boy could list them."</p>
