    <h1>Welcome Back</h1>
    <p>
      You’ve made it this far — but the true trial begins now.<br>
      Every step from here will test more than just your wit; it will challenge your very perception of reality.<br>
      Knowledge, patience, and perception will be your only allies, but even they may betray you if you falter.<br>Fail, and the path ahead will close forever, leaving the truth buried where no one can reach it.<br>Remember: the obvious may be a trap, and the hidden may be the key.<br>Look closer, think deeper, and question everything — only then will the next door reveal itself.
